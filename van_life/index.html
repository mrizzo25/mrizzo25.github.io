	</ul>
 
    <p>Some reasoning behind a couple of these purchases: the things I bought were not the things I initially
    intended to buy. However, in the interest of balancing quality and convenience, I went with
    the items that were agreed upon to be reliable, and were readily available. Initially, I was
    going to go with a denatured alcohol stove, because the fuel is generally cheaper and there is 
	no risk of a gas leak. However, larger alcohol stoves can get pretty expensive, and my parents 
	weren't comfortable with me using one of the smaller, less stable stoves, so we ended up opting
	for propane. Additionally, I was planning on just buying an electric cooler, but seemingly the 
	only well-reviewed options on Amazon were 40 gallons and upward. In lieu of purchasing something 
	bulky and less efficient (thermoelectic cooling tends to consume more energy and be less
	reliable than compression cooling) we opted with a regular, small refrigerator. This way, we
	have the option of swapping it out with something even more efficient - like a Dometic -
	in the future.</p>

	<p>The additional benefit to installing a refrigerator is that it introduces the option to 
	install an external thermostat relay. The components to assemble one are fairly cheap 
	(the relay unit itself costs only $12), and it allows for a little more control over 
	refrigeration efficiency. Basically, all you need to do is wire the relay so that the fridge
	only draws power when the internal temperature exceeds a certain point, which can be
	done directly from an isolator.</p>

	<p>In addition to the components I ordered online, I also purchased the materials I'll need
	for building a base in the van interior. For insulation, we purchased a roll of Reflectix
	and two 1" polyiso foam sheets. The Reflectix will be used on the floor (under paneling), 
	and on any oddly contoured areas of the interior. I plan on gluing foam paneling to the rest
	of the interior, and then filling in any gaps with spray foam. Additionally, we purchased 
	several sheets of 1/2" plywood and 1/8" underlayment. The plywood will be used for the floor
	and various other features, and the underlayment will be used as paneling.</p>


	<p>Things I still need to buy include:</p>

	<ul>
	<li>Inverter (>600 Watt)</li>
	<li>Sink pump</li>
	<li>Water container(s)</li>
	<li>6 (or 4) gauge wire</li>
	<li>Battery monitor</li>
	</ul>

	<p>So, in terms of supplies, I'm basically set. All that is required is some assembly.</p>


	<b>Construction Progress</b>

	<p>Yesterday, we were able to install the vent fan. This was actually fairly simple; using
	the dimensions of the fan, we centered it between the last two ceiling ribs. We then traced
	and cut a hole in the roof, drilled holes, caulked around the edge of the cut, and screwed
	the fan in. After that, we went material shopping.</p>

	<p>Today we were able to get a considerable amount done. Using the floor mat - the one we 
	initially removed - as a template, we cut the 1/2" plywood to fit the floor of the cargo 
	area. After laying out some of the larger components, we opted to assemble the main shelves.
	Fortunately, we had some unused metal shelving lying around, which we ended up using in lieu
	of assembling entirely new shelves. We decided to split the shelving unit into two sets, 
	each with three shelves. For the set closest to the cabin, we cut down the shelves width-wise, to
	optimize counter space. Ultimately, the shelving assembly ends up covering most of the back
	right side of the cargo area, so we will likely only panel the shelves, and then black out
	the window they cover. So far, only the backmost shelves are assembled; the frontmost set
	have been cut accordingly but still need sanding and painting. </p>

	<p> Beyond the aforementioned, I was able to cut out cardboard templates for insulation above
	the wheel wells.
	Turns out some critter - probably a mouse - has decided to steal chunks of the 
	fiberglass insulation I put in the bigger hull cavities, so we set out some traps tonight. 
	Tomorrow I'm aiming to finalize the insulation, and 
	work on cleaning up the second set of shelves.</p>

	    <h3>Bed Liner and Some Insulation</h3>
        <h5 style="font-size: 9pt; margin-top:-10px; font-weight: normal"><i>June 19, 2018</i></h5>

		<p> Yesterday I didn't get much done because I had appointments/work to take care of, so
		I'm including what I was able to do in this post. During the evening, I was able to finish
		a first pass at sanding the floor of the interior, which, in the process, revealed a few
		more holes in the floor. I sealed those off, and ground/sanded off most of the rust
		spots. On an unrelated note, turns out high-velocity metal shavings make a great exfoliant!

        </div>




		<p> This morning
		I finished sanding, by going back over everything with the most adorable little orbital
		sander I have ever seen. I then manually finished off spots I couldn't reach with the 
		orbital sander using some 50 grit sandpaper. I also re-caulked some holes, and while waiting for
		that to set, I filled in some of the bigger cavities in the hull with fiberglass insulation.
		So that they didn't fall through, I sprayed the back of each piece of insulation with 
		adhesive.</p>

		<p>After so much prep, I finally got around to painting on the truck bed liner. Basically, 
		I just rolled in on like any normal paint, and filled in edges and hard to reach spaces with
		an old paintbrush. Pro-tip: if you are planning in doing this to a vehicle at any point, make
		sure you have a rubber (or comparably dense material) paint roller cover. I went with a regular 
		polyester roller cover, and the bed liner completely shredded it while I was painting it on. 
		That stuff dries very quickly, and is incredibly adhesive. A lot of turpentine was needed for
		cleanup.

        <p>
		This morning, we finished tacking the patch on the left side to the body
		and repeated the process for the smaller rust hole on the right side. 
		To seal some of the gaps, we sprayed the underside of the hull with
		undercoating.

		<p>
		Physically, not much else got done today. We did, however, lay out more of a plan
		of action for going forward with the rest of the build. Since we need to put up 
		insulation before doing anything else, I did some research into which materials
		are the most cost effective, and found a pretty comprehensive guide <a href="https://gnomadhome.com/van-build-insulation/">here</a>.
		I've settled on a combination of polyiso foam board, Reflectix for the windows, and
		 fiberglass for smaller cavities in the hull, all things that I can pick up at a local hardware store.
		Using some cardboard templates, I'm probably going to just cut out shapes and 
		and affix the foam board insulation directly to the hull, using either spray adhesive
		or Great Stuff spray foam.
		I'm going to skip insulation on the floor, and just proceed with water-proofing.  
		</p>


		<p>
		Aside from insulation, I'm going to aim to install a roof vent, and then start affixing
		some plywood paneling to the interior, so I have a base on which to build. As far as layout, I'm
		going to keep it fairly simple, and just have a collapsable bed, a cooking area, and some shelving, 
		with extra storage areas wherever I'm able to fit them. 
		Most of the building materials I'm planning on salvaging from my dad's plethora of
		scrap wood, so the main cost going foward will be components. 
		Component-wise, I've got an 85AH deep-cycle marine battery on the way, and am going to order a
		VSR isolater, an inverter, and a fuse panel. 
		For now, I'm going to skip solar panels, and just charge the aux battery off of the 	
		alternator. 
		The only things I'll be running off the aux battery are lights, an electric cooler,
		a vent fan, small electronics (phone, laptop, etc.),  and potentially a water pump. 
		Again, the final result all depends on time and money. So once I've finished building
        a base, I can start considering how complex I want the interior to be. 		 
		</p>

		<p>
		For the remainer of	the day, I cleaned up the interior of the van a bit with a shop vac, 
		and sealed all of the holes and gaps in the floor with silicone caulk. I purchased some
		roll-on truck bed liner (a shockingly expensive $89 for a gallon), which I'll start applying
		tomorrow evening.

		<h3>Meet Simone</h3>
		<h5 style="font-size: 9pt; margin-top:-10px; font-weight: normal"><i>June 16, 2018</i></h5>

		<p>So, after some waiting on a title transfer, we finally have possession of the van! 
		As many of you are aware, I am planning on embarking on a cross-country, month (or more) 
		long road trip. In order to complete the experience, with the help of my parents, I 
		purchased a lovely 1999 Ford E-150 cargo van, which I've named Simone.</p>

		<p> Currently, the van has only around 90 thousand miles on it, and absolutely nothing in 
		it but the bare necessities. The cargo area was completely empty when we purchased it, 
		except for a gross old floor mat covering the bed (not pictured). The first thing we 
		did after bringing her home was tear out the mat, so we could assess the condition of the hull, and see what would need 
		to be done to ensure that the floor will be water-tight.  
		</p>

		</div>


		<br>

		<p>With the mat out of the way, we could see that there were a few spots where the bed had
		rusted through, and needed to be patched (pictured above). For the rest of the day, 
		I helped my dad square away the holes, and cut some sheet metal to use as patches. In theory, 
		we hoped to be able to insert the patches between the chassis and the body of the van, 
		and then weld them on. </p>

		<p>By the end of the day, we were able to weld a patch to the left wheel well, and
		secure the floor patch on the left side. Having established a process, we aimed to 
		patch the other side the following day. </p>
